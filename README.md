## Project Overview

The Casino-Frontend project is a state-of-the-art web application designed to enhance the user experience on our casino platform. Built with React and TypeScript, this project ensures high performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## Core Features

- **Responsive UI/UX**: Ensures an optimal experience across all devices.
- **TypeScript**: Provides robust type-checking, reducing runtime errors.
- **Automated CI/CD**: Streamlines the development and deployment process via GitHub Actions.
- **GitHub Pages**: Facilitates easy and reliable hosting of the application.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive and modern interfaces.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the static files of the application.

## Considerations

### Why React and TypeScript?

React is chosen for its component-based architecture, which enhances reusability and maintainability. TypeScript is incorporated to leverage static typing, which reduces the likelihood of runtime errors and improves code quality. This combination allows for building robust and scalable applications.

### Material-UI

Material-UI is selected for its comprehensive set of pre-designed components, which speeds up the development process while ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application. Its theming capabilities also allow for easy customization to match the branding requirements.

### GitHub Actions and Pages

GitHub Actions is employed for its seamless integration with GitHub repositories, allowing us to automate the CI/CD process efficiently. GitHub Pages is used for its simplicity and reliability in hosting static sites, making it an ideal choice for deploying our frontend application.
